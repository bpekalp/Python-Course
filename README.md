# Web Apps
You can find all the web apps that I developed in [this website!](https://gbp-python-webapps.streamlit.app/)

## To-Do App
To-Do application comes with 3 variations:

- **CLI**
- **GUI**
- **Web App**

You can launch the CLI version by running it with the command:
`python cli.py`

You can launch the GUI version by downloading the release or running it with the command:
`python gui.py`

You can launch the Web version by visiting my web apps site or running it with the command:
`streamlit run web.py`
